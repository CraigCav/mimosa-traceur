Building a Module
===

`mimosa mod:install` is how you would install this module locally to test it.

The contents of this skeleton consist of some example code, a ton of comments and some [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/) style documentation.

If you have any questions about building a mimosa module, feel free to hit up @mimosajs or open up [an issue](https://github.com/dbashford/mimosa/issues?state=open) for discussion purposes.

The rest of this README is what you may want to transform the README to once development is complete.
